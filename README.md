conda activate testenv
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


2. Download and extract the test dataset
```bash
gdown 1cUMKuaC5HvfSDBHM3I-ubhnkb8oYQOpY
tar -xvzf testset.tar.gz
```

3. Download and extract the pretrained models
```bash
gdown 1Nfov-AWuc7Aouy_-tEljGrRP3uT1A4oz
tar -xvzf trained_models.tar.gz
